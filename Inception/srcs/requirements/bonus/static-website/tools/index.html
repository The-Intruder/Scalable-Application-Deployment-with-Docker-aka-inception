		<p>I'm a full-stack web developer with experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. I'm passionate about building websites and web applications that are both functional and beautiful. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games and learning new technologies. I'm a student who attends a coding school called "42", which was founded in France and has since expanded to multiple locations around the world. The school is known for its unique pedagogy, which focuses on project-based learning, peer-to-peer review, and a collaborative approach to problem-solving. 42 students are self-directed and motivated learners who engage in a rigorous curriculum that includes programming, algorithms, and computer science fundamentals. The school is open to anyone, regardless of background or experience, and is completely free. 42 students are known for their dedication, passion, and creativity, and often go on to successful careers in the tech industry.</p>
